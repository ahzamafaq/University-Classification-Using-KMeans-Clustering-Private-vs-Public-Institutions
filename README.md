# University-Classification-Using-KMeans-Clustering-Private-vs-Public-Institutions
This project applies KMeans Clustering to classify 777 universities into Private and Public groups based on 18 variables. While the dataset includes labels, we'll ignore them during clustering to mimic real-world unsupervised learning scenarios. Evaluation will be done post-clustering using the actual labels.
